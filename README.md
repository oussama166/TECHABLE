# Teachable

Teachable is a platform similar to Coursera and Udemy, but with a focus on software engineering. The project is divided into two sides: the front end and the back end.

## Front End
The front end of Teachable is located in the `themes` folder. It consists of various files including JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The front-end development of Teachable utilizes the following technologies:
